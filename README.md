# About
This repoository cointains the code I use to create population density maps as well as shaded relief graphics using [Kontur](https://www.kontur.io/geospatial-datasets-catalog/) population data and the [`rayshader`](https://www.rayshader.com/) R package by Tyler Morgan-Wall. I take huge inspiration from [Spencer Schien](https://github.com/Pecners) whose maps and code are a massive help as I'm learning to make these.
